This is the code for classification using PPO with ICM module ([Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/pathak17a/pathak17a.pdf)). The model also uses GAE ([High-Dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438)) method. By cropping the images, the model can zoom in and classify small objects.
